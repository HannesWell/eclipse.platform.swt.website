<h1>Eclipse &quot;New and Noteworthy&quot; Template</h1>
<p>Last revised Feb. 9, 2005</p>
<p>This is the template for the &quot;New and Noteworthy&quot; document that
accompanies each Eclipse milestone build.</p>
<table border="0" width="80%" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0">
  <tr>
    <td colspan="2">
      <hr>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="30%" valign="top" align="left">
      <p align="right"><b>Item title, right justified, in bold, with no trailing
      punctuation</b></td>
    <td width="70%" valign="top">A blurb pitched to a run-of-the mill user of
      Eclipse (not to members the Eclipse development team). Think of the
      Eclipse newsgroup as your readership, and imagine what you write showing
      up in an &quot;Eclipse Tip of the Day&quot; dialog. Try to generate some
      excitement; save the boring details for the manual. The description should
      be complete sentences, with trailing punctuation. Also, make it clear to
      the reader when a feature is something that's part of the Java IDE (say
      &quot;Java&quot; somewhere) or only found in PDE (say &quot;PDE&quot;).
      Stick to the default font and size.
      <p>If a small image sheds light, place it below the description, in a
      separate paragraph. Regular screen snapshots should be done on Windows XP.
      Crop out any extraneous stuff to focus the reader's attention on your new
      feature. <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">The image should be no
      more than 466 pixels wide and in PNG-24 format</span> (as opposed to GIF,
      TIF, BMP, or JPG).</p>
      <p>Microsoft Paint actually saves to PNG on Windows XP and can easily be
      used to crop and save screenshots:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Arrange the windows for the shot</li>
        <li>Use the Print Screen key (or Alt+Print Screen) to capture the screen</li>
        <li>Open Paint (under All Programs &gt; Accessories)</li>
        <li>Ctrl+V to paste</li>
        <li>Select the area you want to keep</li>
        <li>Ctrl+C to copy it</li>
        <li>Ctrl+N to create a new canvas (ok to discard old one)</li>
        <li>Ctrl+V to paste selected portion</li>
        <li>Save As PNG</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Name the file is a way that is appropriate and specific to the item
      (e.g., key-bindings.png, rather than something generic like image.png).
      Use only lowercase letters in the image file name.</td>
